# hello-world
This is going to be my first time in GitHub to learn about it.
So this is where I am learning to make changes in branches and see how it effects the real one ( I mean the master one)



-I like C programming and but not much of Java. I do like electronic hardwares where you have endless possibilites.
Keep this on mind about how you're going to change the world.
I have this inner feeling where I feel that I will be contributing to the world to make it a better place.
like Elon Musk, he is kind of an inspiration for me.
